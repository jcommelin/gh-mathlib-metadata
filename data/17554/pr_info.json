I marked the definition and lemmas for this computation as private, because I don’t think they would be useful as standalone lemmas.\r\n\r\nI also went with the \"Monoidal\" notations coming from `ChosenFiniteProduct` instances for the computation, because it seemed to work better for the back-and-forth between presheaves and types, but this require introducing an isomorphism that compares it to the usual product, that I also marked as private since it is auxiliary to the computation here.\r\n\r\nSadly, I had to prove by hand that tensoring on the left/right preserves colimits (also marked private). This should normally come from the fact that the monoidal structure on types is cartesian closed, but the `CartesianClosed` instance defined in `CategoryTheory/Closed/Types` is actually about a different monoidal structure than the one defined in `CategoryTheory/Monoidal/Types/Basic` (the former is the one coming from `monoidalOfHasFiniteProducts`, while the latter is the one from `monoidalOChosenFiniteProducts`). If this gets changed then this should trim a bit of noise from the proof.\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",
