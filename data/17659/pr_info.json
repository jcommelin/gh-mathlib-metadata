It's a bit specific and the use of natural subtraction makes me a bit iffy.\r\n\r\nI needed this when I was showing that for all `n > 1`, the Fermat Number `F_n` can be written in infinitely many ways as `n^2 - 2m^2` for positive natural `m` and `n`. For this one needs a starting case and then can construct bigger and bigger examples. (Now of course one can ask what this would be needed for...)\r\nI though this two term non-linear recursion is so basic that it might be useful in other contexts. \r\nBut I'm happy to close this pr if you think it is useless.\r\nI think I partly share the suspicion of natural subtraction, at least I can't think of other simple recursive formulas relating simple sequences of natural numbers, which cannot be rewritten in a way to avoid the subtraction.",

This follows from the theory of Pell equations. So the \"infinitely many ways\" assertion is not surprising here. \r\n\r\nI think there's no harm in adding a lemma for the specific identity you're using here, `fermatNumber (n + 2) = (fermatNumber (n + 1)) ^ 2 - 2 * (fermatNumber n - 1) ^ 2`. But it needs a better name; and  I completely agree with @vihdzp that the use of Nat subtraction should be avoided. I would suggest you write it as an identity for `(fermatNumber (n + 2) : \\Z)` instead, so the subtraction on the RHS is interpreted as integer rather than Nat subtraction. ",

It's a bit specific and the use of natural subtraction makes me a bit iffy.\r\n\r\nI needed this when I was showing that for all `n > 1`, the Fermat Number `F_n` can be written in infinitely many ways as `n^2 - 2m^2` for positive natural `m` and `n`. For this one needs a starting case and then can construct bigger and bigger examples. (Now of course one can ask what this would be needed for...)\r\nI though this two term non-linear recursion is so basic that it might be useful in other contexts. \r\nBut I'm happy to close this pr if you think it is useless.\r\nI think I partly share the suspicion of natural subtraction, at least I can't think of other simple recursive formulas relating simple sequences of natural numbers, which cannot be rewritten in a way to avoid the subtraction.",

This follows from the theory of Pell equations. So the \"infinitely many ways\" assertion is not surprising here. \r\n\r\nI think there's no harm in adding a lemma for the specific identity you're using here, `fermatNumber (n + 2) = (fermatNumber (n + 1)) ^ 2 - 2 * (fermatNumber n - 1) ^ 2`. But it needs a better name; and  I completely agree with @vihdzp that the use of Nat subtraction should be avoided. I would suggest you write it as an identity for `(fermatNumber (n + 2) : \\Z)` instead, so the subtraction on the RHS is interpreted as integer rather than Nat subtraction. ",
