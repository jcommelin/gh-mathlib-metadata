        "body": "This PR adds a macro rule to the `erw` tactic that first tries `rw` at reducible transparency, and displays a \"Try this:\" if that succeeded. This should help us get rid of uselessly slow `erw`s.\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively simple implementation that does not verify if `erw` and `rw` would have resulted in the same exact rewrite. So it is possible that `erw` and `rw` both succeed but rewrite different occurrences, and there would be a suggestion to replace `erw` with `rw` in that case. I think the complication of running both at the same time and checking the goal state afterwards doesn't weigh up to accepting that this happens and adding an explanation to the warning generated by `erw`.\r\n\r\nI import the `erw` extension in `Tactic.Common`: it might be nice to migrate this up even earlier in the import hierarchy but `Mathlib.Tactic.TryThis` is a somewhat heavy import to put in `Mathlib.Tactic.Core`.\r\n\r\nZulip thread: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Fixing.20the.20.60erw.60.20hell.20around.20concrete.20categories\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] depends on: #17617 \r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Or is the idea that this will reduce slow erw's over time, and hence be worth it even if it's a small slow-down?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the speedcenter was still down yesterday, and I don't see any movement in the [zulip thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/mathlib4.20speedcenter). I agree that this will make Mathlib a bit slower, but the extra cost of doing a `rw` in addition to `erw` should make that cost somewhat marginal. And removing `erw`s definitely makes up for that. And even if it weren't about speed, then simply cleaning up `erw`s that don't need to be `erw` is nice for code clarity.",

Or is the idea that this will reduce slow erw's over time, and hence be worth it even if it's a small slow-down?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the speedcenter was still down yesterday, and I don't see any movement in the [zulip thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/mathlib4.20speedcenter). I agree that this will make Mathlib a bit slower, but the extra cost of doing a `rw` in addition to `erw` should make that cost somewhat marginal. And removing `erw`s definitely makes up for that. And even if it weren't about speed, then simply cleaning up `erw`s that don't need to be `erw` is nice for code clarity.",
