It is written for the special case of polynomials but applies mutatis mutandis to general functions.

Note that \"discConv_discConv\", the key lemma which is `sorry`ed in your treatment, would be automatic in our approach: it is subsumed by the fact that any abelian group `G` is canonically a module over its own endomorphism algebra `Module.End ℤ (G → G)`, and we can compose this with the natural map from `ℤ[X]` to `Module.End ℤ (G → G)` sending `X` to the shift-by-1 operator, to obtain a module action of polynomials on `G → G` with `X` acting as the shift. Then Newton-Gregory is just the binomial expansion of `((X - 1) + 1) ^ n`.",

Note that \"discConv_discConv\", the key lemma which is `sorry`ed in your treatment, would be automatic in our approach: it is subsumed by the fact that any abelian group `G` is canonically a module over its own endomorphism algebra `Module.End ℤ (G → G)`, and we can compose this with the natural map from `ℤ[X]` to `Module.End ℤ (G → G)` sending `X` to the shift-by-1 operator, to obtain a module action of polynomials on `G → G` with `X` acting as the shift. Then Newton-Gregory is just the binomial expansion of `((X - 1) + 1) ^ n`.",
